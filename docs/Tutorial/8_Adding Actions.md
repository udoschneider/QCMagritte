## Actions for the whole entity

In this chapter we will go into some more details of the descriptions,

<div>

An action that is relevant for the whole entity, can be added as a  
container action.

containerActions: aContainer  
\<magritteContainer\>  
^aContainer  
addCommand: 'Start' condition: \[ :row | row canStart \] action: \[ :row
| row start \];  
yourself  

</div>

An action that is relevant for one field only, can be added by setting
commands: in the description.

<div>

domain object use a block.
