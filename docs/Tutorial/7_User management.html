<h1>User management</h1><p>Now that we have a todolist with projects, the next logical step would be adding users and allowing users to manage their own things. So in this chapter we will add users, a login, a team to the project, and basic security.		This chapter is work in progress</p><h2>Users</h2><p>First we are going to define our own users. Just try and add a user role and a user to the system. You will notice that there are still some things to be configured.</p><div><p>First of all we need to define that classes that have rights in our system. By default you can set rights to the user overview.<br/></p><p class="code">QCUser subclass: #TodoUser<br/>	instanceVariableNames: ''<br/>	classVariableNames: ''<br/>	category: 'Tutorial-Model'<br/></p><p>We also customize the user role.<br/></p><p class="code">QCModifyableUserRole subclass: #TodoUserRole<br/>	instanceVariableNames: ''<br/>	classVariableNames: ''<br/>	category: 'Tutorial-Model'<br/></p><p>Now we can create a customized user overview. We have 2 overrides in the class:<br/></p><p class="code">userClasses<br/>	^{ TodoUser }<br/></p><p class="code">userRoles<br/>	^{ TodoUserRole }<br/></p><p>As we create our users and roles using QC Magritte, the useroverview has a magritte description for both. We specify here the classes that can be expected and created by the user. We now add the user overview to the model. We add an instance variable for this with accessors and the following magritte description:<br/></p><p class="code">descriptionUserOverview<br/>	&lt;magritteDescription&gt;<br/>	^MAToOneRelationDescription new<br/>		label: 'Users';<br/>		accessor: #userOverview;<br/>		priority: 50;<br/>		classes: { TodoUserOverview };<br/>		beRequired;<br/>		yourself<br/></p><p>Go back to your application and see how it looks. Did you remember to add the initialization code for the userOverview?<br/></p><p>Remeber that this is the barre minimum for user management. You probably want to have a user name for the users as well. Extend the user with a first name and a sur name. Now override the method &quot;username&quot; to display the first name. This method is determine what name is displayed when you are logged in.<br/></p></div><h2>Rights</h2><p>Having defined users is only the first step. Just try and add a user role and a user to the system. You will notice that there are still some things to be configured.</p><div><p>First of all we need to define that classes that have rights in our system. By default all classes marked with &quot;hasUserRights&quot; will appear in the list. We probably want to narrow this list further. For this we override the &quot;allModelClasses&quot;<br/></p><p class="code">allModelClasses<br/>	^(RPackage organizer packageNamed: 'Tutorial-Model') classes<br/></p><p>In smalltalk we can inspect all classes in the system. They are organized in &quot;packages&quot;. In order to create a list of all classes we have modelled, we can limit ourself to the pacakge &quot;Tutorial-Model&quot;. Go back to the site and check what rights we can add to a role now.<br/></p><p>As you can see, not all classes are shown. Only the classes with the flag &quot;hasUserRights&quot; will show up. We will add the TodoProjects and TodoItems to the list, by adding the following method to the class side of these classes<br/></p><p class="code">hasUserRights<br/>	^true<br/></p><p>Now go back to the site and check again. Now it is time to put security in place. Set the following method in your application model:<br/></p><p class="code">users<br/>	^self userOverview users<br/></p><p>As you can see, we only link our users to the users in our user overview. If we have added an admin user, we will have user management. Now see how it looks like. If you did not add an admin user, do so now. And then reset the session.<br/></p></div><h2>Security</h2><p>Having an admin will start the user management. Having user management means you can login. This was added to the header of the page. Also not everything is visible any more. We cannot add users or projects.</p><div><p>User management works as follows: an admin can see all things and modify them. A guest with no login can see all objects that have no security set. Since we set security to the projects and not to the todo items, people will be able to add todo items.<br/></p><p>Notice that the project is removed properly. A todo item may have a project, but this project is not visible in the overview. Also opening the details, the project will not show up. Guests will not be able to modify the project of the todo item, because he is not allowed to read projects.<br/></p><p>Now we are going to create a Reader, someone who is allowed to see projects but nothing more. Login with your admin user, and create a role with the title &quot;Reader&quot;. Add the right &quot;R&quot; (read) for the modelclass &quot;TodoProject&quot; to this role. Now create a user (&quot;reader&quot;) with only the role &quot;Reader&quot; and login with the new user. Here you can see that this user is allowed to see projects, and can change the project in the todo items. But he cannot add projects or change projects. Notice that he can still add todo items to a project, by assigning a todo item to a certain project.<br/></p><p>Now we are going to create a Project managemer. He is allowed to create, change and update projects. Updating only concerns the title. Login as admin again, and create a role &quot;manager&quot; with the rights &quot;C&quot; (create), &quot;R&quot; (read) and &quot;U&quot; (update) for the modelclass &quot;TodoProject&quot;. Also give him the right &quot;R&quot; on TodoUser. Do not give him the right &quot;D&quot; (destroy). Also create a user with this role and see that he can add projects. He will not be able to see users, as this is in the menu &quot;UserOverview&quot; and he does not have rights on this.<br/></p><p>We finally want to add a &quot;useradmin&quot;, that is allowed to create users, reset passwords and assign roles. Note that for this we have to add 3 rights. For the useroverview (R), for the users (CRU) and for the roles (R). Now try and add a user with both the role useradmin and reader. See that this person can read projects and add users.<br/></p></div><h2>Team</h2><p>You can see that QC Magritte has the &quot;normal&quot; user management system using CRUD rights available. Now we are going to make things more complex, by creating a team to a project. This team should of course be able to see everything on his/her project, but not on other projects.</p><div><p>Note: there is a problem here in the bootstrap template ... work in progress<br/></p><p>First we are going to add a description for the team members in the project. Since the team members are actually the normal users, we are going to use the following description:<br/></p><p class="code">descriptionTeamMembers<br/>	&lt;magritteDescription&gt;<br/>	^QCToManyOptionRelationDescription new<br/>		label: 'Team';<br/>		accessor: #teamMembers;<br/>		priority: 350;<br/>		classes: { TodoUser };<br/>		options: [ self allProjectUsers ];<br/>		yourself<br/></p><p>And since we only want the &quot;normal&quot; users to be part of the project we use this as the accessor:<br/></p><p class="code">allProjectUsers<br/>	^self model users select: [ :each | each isAdminUser not ]<br/></p><p>Now go back to the browser and check how it works out. Notice that the manager can now select users and add them to his team and remove them again. He cannot see the roles of these users, as he does not have any rights on the roles. He can change the details of the user (not the userid) and if he adds himself, he can change his own password here.<br/></p></div><h2>Custom security</h2><p>We want team members to be able to modify their project</p><div></div><h2>Json</h2><p>We want to export json.</p><div></div><h2>Save and quit</h2><p>Remember to save your packages in monticello and save and quit your image.</p><div></div>
